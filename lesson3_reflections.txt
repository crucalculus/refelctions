lesson3_reflections.txt

The first reflection in lesson3 asks me to comment on when I would want to use a remote
repo rather than keep everything local.

The obvious answer is that putting stuff into a github repo allows others to look at what I've
done, and perhaps contribute in some way.

The second reflection asks me to consider why I would want to always pull
changes from a remote rather than having git automatically stay up to date
with the remote history.

I think the answer here is that there would be times I would want to complete
work locally on a project without having to worry about if someone else
pushed to the github repo. I don't want other changes that other people have
done being automatically pulled in to my local repo. Also, I want to be sure
that I have things working locally the way I want before I decide to share
my updates.
