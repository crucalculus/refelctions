lesson3_reflections.txt

The first reflection in lesson3 asks me to comment on when I would want to use a remote
repo rather than keep everything local.

The obvious answer is that putting stuff into a github repo allows others to look at what I've
done, and perhaps contribute in some way.

The second reflection asks me to consider why I would want to always pull
changes from a remote rather than having git automatically stay up to date
with the remote history.

I think the answer here is that there would be times I would want to complete
work locally on a project without having to worry about if someone else
pushed to the github repo. I don't want other changes that other people have
done being automatically pulled in to my local repo. Also, I want to be sure
that I have things working locally the way I want before I decide to share
my updates.

The third reflection asks me to describe the differences between forks,
clones, and branches. A fork is a copy on the github server of another
repo. A clone is a copy from the github server remote onto my local computer,
and a branch is a copy of the local repo that diverges from the master
branch.

The fourth refelction asks me to reflect on the benefits of having a copy
of the last known state of the remote stored locally.

The answer seems pretty clear at this point - having a local copy avoids
the need to internet access to the remote repo. So if I want to do a diff
between my current local copy and the remote copy, I don't have to send
info on the internet to do it, since all the data I would need to do the
diff is stored locally.
